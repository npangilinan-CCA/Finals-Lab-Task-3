# [Finals Lab Task 3 - Table Manipulation](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19792667/pangilinan_FinalsLabTask3.docx)
This portfolio is about table manipulation in SQL, focusing on altering existing tables, adding constraints like primary or foreign keys, and modifying fields to change their data types or attribute.

## Step by Step Process
### Task 1: Creating the products table
- Define id as unique integer, auto-increment, and as a primary key.
- Define product_name as a VARCHAR (up to 100 characters) and make it not null.
- Define price as a decimal.
  
### Task 2: Adding a constraint
- Use the alter table statment on the products table
- Adding a check constraint to check if all prices are greater than 0.
  
### Task 3: Inserting products
- Using the insert into statement on the products table to add products that will not violate the constraint.
